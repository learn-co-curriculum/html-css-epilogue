## What's Next?

Congratulations you've made it! Take a moment to bask in the glow of your new ability to build web sites. 

### Staying Sharp

Now you can spend time to go back and review all the previous weeks. Make sure to complete all the labs and quizzes, and make sure to write some new code everyday. Make sure to sign up for [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) so you have an online community you can troubleshoot your code issues with, ask questions, and answer other peoples coding questions as well. Become active in the code community by attending [Meet ups](http://www.meetup.com/find/?allMeetups=false&keywords=programming&radius=5&userFreeform=10010&gcResults=New+York%2C+NY+10010%2C+USA%3AUS%3ANew+York%3ANew+York+County%3ANew+York%3AManhattan%3A10010%3A40.7388319%3A-73.9815337&sort=default) and [Hackathons](https://www.eventbrite.com/directory?q=hackathon&loc=New+York%2C+NY) to keep your skills sharp. Start a code blog and share what your learning with the community. Browse all the Bonus resources from this course and begin to read books on programming. Check back on this site periodically for updates.
